<p>Soybeans and soybean products are receiving increased attention at the
present time when the rationing of many of the protein-rich foods of
animal origin has made us aware of the possibility of insufficient
protein in our dietaries.</p>

<p>This interest is highly desirable, since soybeans are such a valuable
source of protein of superior quality, of calcium and iron, and of at
least some of the members of the vitamin B complex. Soybeans also have a
high caloric value due to fat content and have a higher energy value per
pound than the other more commonly used legumes, with the exception of
peanuts.</p>

<p>Soybean products are sometimes called "diabetic foods" because they
contain no starch. It should be remembered, however, that soybeans
contain some soluble sugars; in all about 10 per cent or more of the
weight of dry soybeans is carbohydrate which the body can utilize. Even
so, this is much less than the carbohydrate content of other beans and
of wheat flour.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="u">Varieties of Soybeans</span></p>

<p>There are two general types of soybeans, the field type and the edible
or vegetable type, which differ greatly in palatability. As the name
implies, the edible or vegetable varieties are more satisfactory for
human consumption, although a few of the field soybeans are also
palatable. Some of the vegetable types which are rated "very good" are
Hokkaido, Willomi, Jogun, Imperial, and Emperor. Among the field
varieties that are satisfactory for edible purposes are the Illini and
Manchu.</p>



<p class="center"><a name="HOW_TO_USE_GREEN_SOYBEANS" id="HOW_TO_USE_GREEN_SOYBEANS"></a><span class="u">HOW TO USE GREEN SOYBEANS</span></p>


<p>Immature soybeans are very welcome as an early fall green vegetable.
Soybeans are ready for table use as soon as the pods have completely
filled out and while they are still green in color. This is in late
August or in September, depending on the variety, the time of planting,
and the season. Not all plants of the same variety mature at the same
time, but usually the maturity of pods on a single plant is sufficiently
uniform to warrant pulling the entire plant. The plants can then be
taken to a shady place to pick off the pods.</p>

<p><span class="u">To make hulling easier</span>, pour boiling water over the soybean pods and let
them stand 5 minutes in the hot water. Drain, and hull by breaking the
pod crosswise and squeezing out the beans. Cook as follows: To 1 pt
hulled beans, add 1 c boiling water and &frac34; t salt. Cover and cook for
10 minutes after the beans begin to boil. Avoid overcooking. Drain, and
season with butter or in any other manner desired. Soybeans of the
vegetable type should still be bright green in color after cooking, and
they will have a nutty texture. They do not soften like green peas but
can be used in any of the ways that green peas or green lima beans are
used.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="u">Preservation</span></p>

<p>Green soybeans can be preserved by freezing, canning, or dehydrating,
although at the present time freezing seems to be the most satisfactory
method. (For directions for freezing see University of Illinois Circular
510, "How to Prepare Fruits and Vegetables for Freezer Storage.")</p>

<p>There is a difference of opinion with regard to the canning of soybeans.
Some feel that the flavor of the green soybean when canned is not
satisfactory, while others report palatable products. Soybeans should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>packed hot after blanching the shelled beans for 3 minutes in boiling
water. Some authorities recommend the addition of 1 t salt and from &frac12;
to 1 t sugar to each pint of green soybeans. U.S.D.A. Farmers' Bulletin
No. 1762 recommends using a pressure cooker at 10 pounds pressure for
the following periods: pint jars, 80 minutes; quart jars, 90 minutes;
No. 2 tin cans, 70 minutes; No. 3 tin cans, 85 minutes. (Soaked mature
soybeans can also be preserved for future use by canning in the same
way.)</p>

<p>For the dehydration of green soybeans, it is generally agreed that a
steam blanching of from 5 to 7 minutes before shelling is satisfactory.
The shelled beans should then be dehydrated at a temperature of 150&deg; F.
for the first half of the dehydration, and at 145&deg; F. for the remainder
of the time. It will take from 6 to 9 hours for the process, and the
finished product will be hard and wrinkled but still green in color.
(For more complete directions for dehydration see University of Illinois
Circular 558, "Dehydrating Fruits and Vegetables at Home.")</p>

<p class="center"><span class="u">Cooking Dry Soybeans</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="u">Method I.</span> Soak 1 c dry soybeans in 3 c water overnight. Drain<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and
cook for 1 to 1&frac12; hours in 3 c fresh water to which 3 t salt have been
added.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> To save nutrients, mild-flavored soybeans may be cooked in
the water in which they were soaked.</p></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="u">Method II.</span> Soak beans as in Method I, cook in a pressure cooker at 10
lbs. pressure for 10 minutes in 1&frac12; c water to which 1&frac12; t salt has
been added.</p>

<p class="noin">The beans may be seasoned with either butter or meat and served, or they
may be used in any of the dishes for which navy or lima beans are used.
They are more nutty in texture, however, than ordinary beans.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="u">Roasted Soybeans</span></p>

<p>Two methods for roasting mature soybeans are given below. The products
in both cases are acceptable, but Method I gives more desirable results,
since the products more nearly resemble roasted peanuts. The second
method is included because of the ease of preparation and as a means of
conserving fat.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="u">Method I.</span> Soak dry soybeans overnight, or until completely swollen.
Dry the surface between towels and fry in deep fat, a few beans at a
time, for 5 to 8 minutes, depending upon the size of the beans
(temperature, 350&deg; F.). When they are slightly brown and crisp, drain,
salt, and use as salted peanuts would be used.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="u">Method II.</span> Soak beans overnight. Dry thoroughly and roll in melted
fat. Spread in a shallow pan and roast in a moderate oven (350&deg; F.)
until browned. Sprinkle with salt while still warm.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="u">Sprouting Dry Soybeans</span></p>

<p>"Soybeans, like mung beans, can be sprouted in a flower pot, a sink
strainer, or any container that has holes in it for drainage and can be
covered. Be sure the container is large enough, for the beans swell to
at least six times their original bulk as they sprout. Soak overnight,
and next morning put the beans in the container,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> cover, and leave them
in a warm place. Flood with lukewarm water at least four or five times
each day during the sprouting period. In 4 to 6 days the sprouts will be
2 to 3 inches long. Then they should be kept in a cool place, just as
any fresh vegetable." (U.S.D.A. Leaflet No. 166, Soybeans for the
Table.)</p>

<p>Some authorities are recommending the use of chlorinated lime (calcium
hypochlorite) during the sprouting period to discourage the growth of
mold and bacteria. The amounts suggested range from &frac12; to 1 t per
gallon of water. This chlorinated water should be used for the last
sprinkling each day, and at other times plain water should be used. It
has also been found that the soybeans should be kept away from the light
while sprouting or they will develop an undesirable color. The first
requisite for soybeans to be sprouted is a variety that will germinate
readily.</p>

<p>Soybean flours will probably be found on the market more generally in
the near future than they have been in the past, and homemakers are
advised to take advantage of the opportunity to use them. These flours
are considered an especially valuable supplement to wheat flour, since
they enhance the nutritive value of baked products from the standpoint
of protein, minerals, and certain members of the vitamin B complex.</p>

<p>At the present time millers are preparing three types of soybean flour,
which differ in fat content. One type contains all the fat found in the
original soybean and is known as high-fat or full-fat flour. There are
also two low-fat flours from which different amounts of fat have been
removed. Because of these differences and the fact that soybean flour
contains little or no starch and no gluten, it is wise to use recipes
that are developed for soybean flour if any appreciable amount is to be
incorporated. A small amount of flour can be added to many recipes (up
to 2 T soybean flour to 14 T wheat flour) without altering the other
ingredients, but above this amount a special recipe should always be
used. The following recipes include directions for incorporating from 15
to 100 per cent soybean flour.</p>

<p>Soybean flour can be used as a meat extender, in gravies, soups, and
sauces, and in a variety of baked products. When substituted for part of
the wheat flour in a recipe, soybean flour has the advantage of giving a
product which tends to brown more readily and will keep fresh for a
longer time. Soybean flour also improves the crust of breads and causes
them to toast even better than usual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

let rise until trebled in bulk (about 2 hours). Punch down and let rise
until double in bulk (about 1 hour). Shape into a loaf and let rise in a
greased pan until double in volume (about 1 hour). This amount of dough
will fill a pan 4 &times; 9 &times; 3 inches, and the dough should rise to 5/8 inch
above the edge of the pan before it is placed in the oven. Bake for 50

<p>There are other forms in which soybeans can be utilized as human food.
Some processors of soybeans are now preparing soybean grits and flakes,
and there is promise that they will be on the retail market in the near
future. These products are similar to soybean flour but are not so
finely ground. The soybean grits usually resemble coarse corn grits but
are sometimes pulverized to resemble corn meal. The flakes are similar
but are flat in shape.</p>

<p>Soybean grits and flakes can be used as cereals, in baked products where
a crisp texture is desirable, or as meat extenders. The greatest
difference in the behavior of the two products is that of liquid
absorption. The soybean grits tend to absorb more liquid than the
flakes, and therefore an adjustment must be made in the recipe when
using these products.</p>
